# AXI4-Lite Master–Slave Protocol Verification (Verilog HDL)

This repository contains a complete implementation and verification of an **AMBA AXI4-Lite Master and Slave** designed in **Verilog HDL** and verified using **ModelSim**.

This project demonstrates:
- RTL design
- Protocol-based FSM implementation
- Functional verification with directed test cases
- Waveform-based validation
